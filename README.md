Objectives
The objective of this project is simply to find, by probability, the race results before they start. Almost always, by the middle of the racing season, there is already a tendency toward the team and driver who will become Formula One world champion, but there's no need to declare victory prematurely. My only objectives are the following:

1. Develop the tire strategy to be used during the race.

2. Predict the top three drivers who will win the race.

Problem Statement
In Formula One, race results depend on a complex combination of factors such as driver performance, weather conditions, track type, tire strategy, and real-time decision-making. Currently, teams invest millions in simulations and analysis to maximize their chances of success, although there are high levels of uncertainty and margin for error in predicting results and strategies.
